## Note

These files are excluded from version control as they contain draft material for academic submission. The directory structure keeps capstone work organized and separate from the public project documentation.

## Research Focus Areas

1. **Dynamic Model Selection**: Real-time evaluation and selection of optimal LLM models
2. **Therapeutic Evaluation**: Quantitative assessment of mental health response quality
3. **Bias Mitigation**: Detection and correction of selection biases
4. **System Architecture**: Production-ready implementation with performance optimization
5. **Clinical Applications**: Pathways to real-world therapeutic deployment

## Academic Significance
