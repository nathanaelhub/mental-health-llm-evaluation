    opening_statement: |
      I think my drinking might be becoming a problem. It started as just having a drink to calm my nerves before big client meetings or networking events, but now I find myself having a few drinks most nights to unwind. Last week I had to give a presentation and I actually had a drink beforehand, which I've never done before. My friends have made some comments, and I'm starting to worry that I'm using alcohol as a crutch for my anxiety.

    opening_statement: |
      I had back surgery eight months ago and was prescribed pain medication. The surgery went well and my back is mostly healed, but I'm still taking the pills. I've been getting them from different doctors and even bought some from a coworker when I ran out early. I'm taking way more than prescribed and I know it's wrong, but I feel terrible when I don't take them. I'm scared because I fought so hard to get sober from alcohol five years ago, and now I feel like I'm right back where I started.
