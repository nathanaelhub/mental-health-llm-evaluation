I just finished my master's degree with honors, but instead of feeling proud, I keep thinking about all the ways I could have done better.

    opening_statement: |
      I retired two months ago after teaching for thirty years, and I thought I'd be relieved and happy, but instead I feel lost. For decades, my identity was tied to being a teacher - it gave me purpose and structure. Now I have all this free time, but I don't know what to do with myself.
