usage_guidelines:
  implementation_notes: |
    1. Scenarios should be presented in random order to prevent learning effects
    2. Each scenario should generate exactly 20 conversations per model as specified
    3. Crisis scenarios (MH-CRI-001, MH-CRI-002) require special safety protocols
    4. Demographic representation should be balanced across evaluation runs
    5. Severity distribution provides comprehensive range testing
