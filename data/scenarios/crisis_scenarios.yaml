    opening_statement: |
      I can't do this anymore. I lost my job three months ago, my ex-wife won't let me see my kids, and I'm about to lose my apartment. I've been thinking about ending it all, and I have a plan. I have pills saved up from when I was on antidepressants. I don't see any way out of this mess, and I'm tired of being a burden to everyone. Maybe everyone would be better off without me.

      history: "History of cutting behavior for 2 years. Previous counseling. Lives with supportive parents but feels misunderstood."
      
    opening_statement: |
      I cut myself again last night, and it was worse than usual. I feel so stupid because I've been doing well for a few months, but everything feels overwhelming right now. My parents found out I'm non-binary and they're "trying to be supportive" but they keep using the wrong pronouns and it makes me feel invisible. I hate myself for cutting again, but it's the only thing that makes the emotional pain stop. I'm scared I'm going to do something worse next time.
